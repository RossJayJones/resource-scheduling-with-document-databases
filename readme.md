# Resource Scheduling Apps with Document Databases

This sample aims to show how a resource scheduling app could be built with a document database system. The sample uses [RavenDB 4.0](https://ravendb.net/). Please refer to this [blog post](https://rossjayjones.github.io/document_databases/architecture/dotnet/2018/03/03/resource-scheduling-apps-with-ravendb.html) for more details.

## Running the tests

The solution uses xunit tests. Please refer to the [RavenDB](https://ravendb.net/docs/article-page/4.0/csharp/start/test-driver) documentation on how to configure a test environment.
